# Maze Game – Labirin Gila

This project is a simple yet complete maze game built with Unity, inspired by the knowledge and skills I gained through an incredible learning opportunity provided by Kemenparekraf, AGATE, and AGI. The training covered various fundamental aspects of game development, and this project serves as a culmination of those lessons.

## Game Overview

**Labirin Gila** ("Crazy Maze") challenges players to navigate their way through a maze, avoiding walls and obstacles, collecting items, and reaching the finish. The game leverages Unity's engine capabilities and basic C# programming.

## Features

- Smooth player movement using Unity’s physics system.
- Maze walls and interactable items set up with collision detection—players cannot walk through walls.
- Multiple game screens, including a main menu and a "You Win" screen, using Unity scene management.
- Audio cues and engaging visual effects (VFX) to enhance the gameplay experience.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive controls.

## Unity Concepts Used

Throughout development, I applied several core Unity concepts:

- **Istilah-Istilah di Unity** (Unity Terminologies)
- **Workspace Unity** (Unity Workspace Familiarization)
- **Basic Unity** (Scene setup, GameObjects, Components)
- **Physics** (Rigidbody, Collider for movement and interactions)
- **Basic Programming in Unity** (C# scripts for player control and game logic)
- **User Interface** (Menus, buttons, win screens)
- **Controlling Object** (Player movement and input handling)
- **Collision Detection** (Preventing the player from passing through walls)
- **Audio** (Background music and sound effects)
- **Scene Management** (Switching between different game screens)
- **Visual Effects (VFX)** (Particle effects for feedback and atmosphere)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diwahsap/labirin-gila.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in [Unity](https://unity.com/):**
   - Recommended Unity version: _[specify version if known]_
3. **Run the game:**
   - Open the main scene and press `Play` in the Unity Editor.

## Acknowledgements

I am grateful to Kemenparekraf, AGATE, and AGI for the amazing opportunity to learn and practice game development. Their support and training were instrumental in making this project possible.
